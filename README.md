## Analyze and manage all your recorded GPS Tracks

ActivityDiary is the digital Diary for all your Activities.
A Diary entry (Activity) consists of:

* GPS information, read from your recorded Track
* User defined add-on informations for your Track (name, profile, weather, description,...)
* Calculated informations (speed, length)

GPS Tracks can be recorded with your favorite GPS Device and imported as GPX Format into ActivityDiary. 
Your imported Track gets visualized in a dynamic Map View, with free maptiles from OpenStreetMap. 
Additional track data informs about time, distance, average speed and average altitude. 
A Chart shows track information (e.g. speed, altitude) relative to the time of the track.
